`gradient-js` is a library that takes your source colors and a configuration object to produce a gradient suitable for your needs. You can choose between css, svg and raw (object) output.

`gradient-js` is built on top of [chroma-js](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js) color manipulation library, written by Gregor Aisch.

You need to install `chroma-js` as a dependency to start working with gradient-js.
